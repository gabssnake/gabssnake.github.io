  -- Sagan

We can choose to descend into pessimism and apathy, assuming that nothing can be done, and helping to ensure that the worst will happen. Or we can grasp the opportunities that exist –and they do– and pursue them to the extent that we can, thus helping to contribute to a better world. Not a very hard choice.
  -- Chomsky
%
We shouldn’t be looking for heroes, we should be looking for good ideas.
  -- Chomsky

The welfare of the people is the ultimate law.
  -- Cicero

It is the peculiar quality of a fool to perceive the faults of others and to forget his own.
  -- Cicero

One must still have chaos in oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing star.
