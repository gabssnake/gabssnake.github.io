    <p>Experienced designer, developer, and product manager, <strong>I'm the ultimate generalist</strong>. Also known as Gabriel Vivas. I've worked in cybersecurity, public safety, and as a contractor for small businesses and agencies. Lately, I’m  deep into static analysis <a href="https://www.sonarsource.com">@sonar</a>.</p>

    <h2>Brand</h2>

    <p>I've worked with small businesses that entrusted me with shaping their brand identity. My work has spanned logo design and essential branding materials like business cards, but often extends to full website design, including copywriting. I've also created custom illustrations when needed.</p>

        <h3>Sapito Saltarin</h3>

        <p>"Jumpy Froggy" kindergarten’s visual identity is as playful and innocent as its name. Back in 2011, I designed and built everything below, from the logo and branding to a fully custom WordPress theme, along with illustrations and copy. Both the branding and website have held up for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110623174528/http://www.sapitosaltarin.com/">over 14 years</a>.</p>
        <p>More recently, I was asked to migrate the domain, make the site responsive, and replace WordPress with a simpler solution. I also refreshed the bitmap illustrations with crisp vectors. <a href="https://sapitosaltarin.com.co/">See it online!</a></p>

        <h2>Illustration</h2>

        <p>If words are food for thought, illustration is the dessert. More than just functional, it makes ideas stick.</p>

        <p>A well-placed visual supports storytelling and amplifies it, turning complex concepts into something tangible. I illustrate when it matters. Whether to clarify, persuade, or simply make an idea more <em>memorable</em>.</p>
